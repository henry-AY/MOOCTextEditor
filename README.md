The MOOCTextEditor was developed as part of the Advanced Data Structures, Embedded Systems and Networking (ADEN). This project supports functionality such as autocomplete, spell-checking, and auto-correct. Through multiple stages, the back-end functionality for the text editor was implemented. University of California, San Diego (UCSD) provided the runnable UI and front-end implementation using JavaFX, along with JUnit tests.
